# Introduction
In this lab, our primary focus was to use tools such as C-SFRAT and Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) with Excel to help us conduct a reliability assessment of the SUT as measured by using one of the provided sample failure test files. In this lab, in the first part, we used C-SFRAT to assess failure data using reliability growth testing which helped us stress the SUT to identify failure modes and weaknesses through a systematic process. In the second part, we assessed failure data using a reliability assessment using the RDC tool, which helped ensure that the same results were given each time in the same setting from an assessment instrument like RDC with Excel. Overall, these tools and applications helps us apply what we learned in lectures about reliability testing and its importance when considering software testing and reliability. 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

## Result of model comparison (selecting top two models)

## Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of the data is good for proceeding with the analysis)

## Plots for failure rate and reliability of the SUT for the test data provided

## A discussion on decision making given a target failure rate

## A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of reliability growth analysis


# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

## 3 plots for MTTFmin, twice and half of it for your test data

## Explain your evaluation and justification of how you decide on the MTTFmin

## A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC
 

# Comparison of Results with Part 1

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Our group encountered a lot of difficulties in the setup of the lab and provided software. With the the rather vague instructions and guidance on the lab, our group had spent unnecessary amounts of time just setting up the data for Part 1 and with the initial setup rather than on the lab content and application of lectures. We overcame these set up challenges by communicating with fellow and former students to help us complete the lab. In addition, we reached out to several TAs for help on the lab. As for lessons learned, we learned how to use the different tools suggested to accurately measure the reliability of a system. However, these tools are only a simulation of how the system should ideally behave. Another lesson learned was how there is a rather high learning curve just to learn the tools to measure the reliability of the system. However, encountering these tools now will hopefully benefit us later as we use tools with higher learning curves.
